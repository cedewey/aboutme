  <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
  <p>Web developer, father, and advocate for all things open source and liberatory. I work at the intersections of justice and technology, helping folks leverage digital tools in their on-the-ground work.</p>
<p>I'm particularly passionate about current struggles to end mass encarceration, work towards racial justice, and heal our communities. I believe free and open technologies can help us communicate across prison walls, effectively share resources with each another and move forward on this path of healthy communities.</p>
  <p>I am a co-maintainer of <a href="http://www.openaiddistro.org">OpenAid</a>, an open-source website starter kit for nonprofits and grassroots organizations and networks. OpenAid features project mapping, a resource library, image galleries, a blog feature and more. I work to both develop the features of OpenAid as well as help organizations get up and running on the platform.</p>

<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
<p>I was born in Oklahoma, but haven't been back since my family moved away when I was five. As a kid I lived in
<ul>
  <li>Dallas</li>
  <li>Singapore</li>
  <li>Seattle</li>
  <li>Houston</li>
</ul>
<p>before finally ending up in Denver. I did the liberal arts thing in the San Juan mountains, spent some time in Chihuhua studying the impact NAFTA has had on the family structure there, then moved up to Laramie, WY.</p>

<p>Eventually I found myself back in Denver, laying down roots with my friends and family on the westside.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <p>When away from the laptop my kids and I are tinkering with technology and embarking on outdoor mini-adventures in around Denver. I also reconcile my atheism with my strong belief in community by attending the <a href="http://fusden.org"> First Unitarian Society of Denver</a>.</p>
  
  <p>I also play the trombone, biding my time for the 4th wave of ska.</p>
